# challenge_04

## Description

This challenge was to take a nested array as found inside the index.js file and use it to create a financial report for a theoretical company, and manipulate the data using JavaScript within the script.js file. I wanted to make sure the file could be used with other data sets as long as they have the same constraints as the original dataset (a 2x2 nested matrix with the date first followed by the figures for that month). When run the final report will be shown in the console of a web browser.

## Installation / Usage

Load the files up on your code editor and paste the data you want analysing in place of the existing data, as long as it has the exact same format. When this is ready, run the code in the browser and check the terminal for the results.

## Credits

Used the following page on StackOverflow in order to find a function that sorted an array by number. [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16096872/how-to-sort-2-dimensional-array-by-column-value] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16096872/how-to-sort-2-dimensional-array-by-column-value)
